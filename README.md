**ABOUT THE PROJECT :**

This Project helps us in Query Management System


In this Website, the Users can register themselves and create an account,having login crednetials for later use. Users can raise a particular query to Management. The user is asked for the date of the Query , the Query and a short description about their query. These details are stored in the Database. 
There exists a person named "Admin" from the side of management who is responsible for looking after the issue. The admin has access to all the queries raised by differnet users along with details such as Date and Time of query,Query Description,etc. There is a feature using which automated Emails are sent to the users once the Admin acknowledges the query from their side.In this Project, we have used Mailgun service for sending automated Emails.
Also, Users have the feauture of viewing the log of the Queries they have raised over a speicific period of time and the status of that query.
